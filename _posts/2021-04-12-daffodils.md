## To Daffodils

__Music by E.J.Moeran__

__Text by Robert Herrick__

__Performed by members of Cockermouth Harmonic Society and Wigton Choral Society__

__Directed by Ian Wright__

This "virtual performance" was created during the Covid-19 period of lockdown in March 2021, when it was not possible to meet together as a choir.    Following a number of practice sessions by video-conferencing, led by Ian, members were invited to record themselves and submit the video/audio recording to Ian, who has blended the individual contributions together into an harmonious whole.
