The Cumbria Rural Choirs 2019 Concert took place in Carlisle Cathedral on 23rd March, when Wigton Choral Society joined with Keswick Choral Society, Ullswater Choir (Penrith)
and independent singers in [Cumbria Rural Choirs](https://cumbria-rural-choirs.org.uk), together with professional soloists and the instrumental accompaniment of the British Sinfonietta, for the performance of two major works:

* __The seven last words of Christ__ (German: _Die sieben letzten Worte unseres Erl&#246;sers am Kreuze_), by Joseph Haydn
* __Requiem in D minor__, by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart

The audience filled the Cathedral and the concert was very well-received.   For a full review, please see the [Cumbria Rural Choirs](https://cumbria-rural-choirs.org.uk) website.
