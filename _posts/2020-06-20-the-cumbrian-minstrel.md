## Summer Concert 2020

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we had to cancel our Summer Concert on Sat 20th June 7.30pm in St Mary's, Wigton.   

The concert, titled "***The Cumbrian Minstrel***", was planned to celebrate the 20th Anniversary of Wigton poet and fiddler John Stagg (1770 - 1823), featuring new work based on Stagg's poems and the music and poetry of his contemporaries, written and conducted by our Music Director, Ian Wright. 

We thank you for your continued support and look forward to seeing you at future concerts.
