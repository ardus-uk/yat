We are also immensely grateful for the gifts and bequests from members and other individuals which we have received to support our music-making.

## Supporting our local charities

Each year we choose a local charity who will benefit from our specific fundraising activities - for example, donations received for our singing carols in local supermarkets in the weeks before Christmas.    The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted these activities, but we hope to resume again in the coming year and will announce our chosen charity in due course.

## Other organisations

### Cumbria Rural Choirs

Since 1951, Cumbria Rural Choirs has brought together singers from across Cumbria and neighbouring areas to perform large scale choral works, often led by internationally-renowned conductors and accompanied by professional musicians and soloists.

With over 100 members it is the largest amateur choir in the County.   Wigton Choral Society is proud to have supported its development and joined in its success.
