## About Wigton Choral Society


:art:&nbsp;WIGTON CHORAL SOCIETY was founded more than fifty years ago and has gained a reputation for a high standard of performance with imaginative programming.



The society was originally established with the twin aims of taking part in the Cumberland Rural Choirs Festival (later to become Cumbria Rural Choirs, and, more recently, Cumbria Singers) and entering music competitions. They certainly had early success in this latter aim, winning two cups in the Carlisle Music Festival the following year, but it was not until 1977, encouraged by Hugh Davies, who took over as Musical Director, that the choir embarked on its first independent venture: a concert of Christmas music at St. Mary's Church, Wigton.


The choir currently has about fifty mixed voices and a repertoire which includes both religious and secular music from the 15th to the 21st centuries. To date, the choir has given two major concerts a year, in December and June, usually at St Mary's Church, Wigton. Until the re-configuration of Cumbria Rural Choirs as "Cumbria Singers", Wigton Choral Society also formed a significant part of that organisation, performing a large-scale choral work each Spring with professional orchestra, soloists and conductor.

Our Musical Director is Ian Wright, who took up the post in January 2008.

### Membership

Society members come from a wide area of north Cumbria, and new members are always welcome. Membership is free for people under 25 in full-time education.

Singing in a choir is a wonderful opportunity to have voice training, learn some of the gems of the choral repertoire, take part in quality performances - and make new friends. Singing can also help your breathing, your stress levels and your health, so if you read music and enjoy singing, bring your voice along and give it a go!
We meet at Wigton Methodist Church, CA7 9PG

### Wigton Choral Society and COVID-19 precautions

Following a period of interruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic (at first cancellation and then use of alternative formats and venues for rehearsals), from September 2021 we have been able to resume our in-person rehearsals at Wigton Methodist Church, 48 High Street, CA7 9PG.  These take place on Thursday evenings from 7.30pm to 9.30pm. with measures in place to minimise risk of infection transmission.

We are rehearsing in Wigton Methodist Church, rather than the Church Hall, which allows more room for physical distancing and has better ventilation. The church has a high ceiling and, where possible, we open windows and doors to maximise airflow. We also maintain social distancing while we are rehearsing.

If you are attending rehearsals, please:
+ Take a lateral flow before you come;
+ DO NOT come if you feel at all unwell;
+ Wear a mask when arriving and leaving and moving around in the building;
+ Take responsibility to keep distanced from other members.

Because the windows and external doors will be kept open, it is advisable to come with warm clothing.

There will be a break as usual. We have the use of the Hall but not the kitchen; therefore please
bring your own refreshment for the break.

Our 2022 rehearsals started on Thursday, January 13th.   We are rehearsing for the June 18th concert, consisting of performances of __The Armed Man__ (Karl Jenkins) and the __Requiem__ by Maurice Durufl&eacute;.

Music is available from our Librarian at the rehearsal.
